# Chocolate Croissants (Pain au Chocolat)

These classic French chocolate croissants are a labor of love, but the results are absolutely worth it. The combination of flaky, buttery pastry with rich dark chocolate creates a breakfast treat that's hard to resist.

## Instructions

### Making the Dough

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Mix well to distribute the ingredients evenly.

2. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it activate for 5 minutes until foamy.

3. Add the milk and yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.

4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

### Laminating the Dough

1. Roll the dough into a rectangle and place the butter in the center.

2. Fold the dough over the butter like a letter, then roll out again.

3. Repeat the folding and rolling process 3 more times, chilling the dough between each turn.

### Shaping and Baking

1. Roll the dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into rectangles.

2. Place a piece of chocolate at one end of each rectangle.

3. Roll up the dough around the chocolate, sealing the edges with a bit of water.

4. Place on a baking sheet and let rise for 1 hour.

5. Brush with egg wash and bake at 400°F for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.

## Tips

- Keep the butter cold throughout the laminating process for the best flaky layers
- Don't rush the rising time - the yeast needs time to work its magic
- Use high-quality chocolate for the best flavor
- The milk should be warm but not hot to avoid killing the yeast

## Storage

These croissants are best eaten fresh from the oven, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes to restore their crispiness.
